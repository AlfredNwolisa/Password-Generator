# Password Generator

This Python script generates a random password based on user-defined criteria. It uses a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, symbols, and numbers to create a strong password.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Clone or download this repository.

## Usage

1. Run the script using the following command in your terminal:

   ```sh
   python password_generator.py
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to specify the length and composition of your desired password.
3. The generated password will be displayed on the screen.

## Requirements

- Python (version 3.x)
- The `string` and `random` modules are used for generating characters.
- The `getpass` module is used for secure user input.

## How It Works

1. The script takes user input for the desired number of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, symbols, and numbers.
2. The `password_generator` function combines the selected character types to create a password.
3. The password is shuffled to enhance randomness.
4. The generated password is displayed for the user.

Feel free to modify and adapt the script to suit your needs.

**Note:** This script may not cover all security best practices, so ensure that you understand the implications of generating passwords for sensitive applications.
